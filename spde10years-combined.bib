	abstract = {Summary A thresholded Gaussian random field model is developed for the microstructure of porous materials. Defining the random field as a solution to stochastic partial differential equation allows for flexible modelling of nonstationarities in the material and facilitates computationally efficient methods for simulation and model fitting. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm is developed and used to fit the model to three-dimensional confocal laser scanning microscopy images. The methods are applied to study a porous ethylcellulose/hydroxypropylcellulose polymer blend that is used as a coating to control drug release from pharmaceutical tablets. The aim is to investigate how mass transport through the material depends on the microstructure. We derive a number of goodness-of-fit measures based on numerically calculated diffusion through the material. These are used in combination with measures that characterize the geometry of the pore structure to assess model fit. The model is found to fit stationary parts of the material well.},

	abstract = {Priors are important for achieving proper posteriors with physically meaningful covariance structures for Gaussian random fields (GRFs) since the likelihood typically only provides limited information about the covariance structure under in-fill asymptotics. We extend the recent penalized complexity prior framework and develop a principled joint prior for the range and the marginal variance of one-dimensional, two-dimensional, and three-dimensional Matérn GRFs with fixed smoothness. The prior is weakly informative and penalizes complexity by shrinking the range toward infinity and the marginal variance toward zero. We propose guidelines for selecting the hyperparameters, and a simulation study shows that the new prior provides a principled alternative to reference priors that can leverage prior knowledge to achieve shorter credible intervals while maintaining good coverage.We extend the prior to a nonstationary GRF parameterized through local ranges and marginal standard deviations, and introduce a scheme for selecting the hyperparameters based on the coverage of the parameters when fitting simulated stationary data. The approach is applied to a dataset of annual precipitation in southern Norway and the scheme for selecting the hyperparameters leads to conservative estimates of nonstationarity and improved predictive performance over the stationary model.

We study the challenges involved in applying a flexible non-stationary model to a dataset of annual precipitation in the conterminous US, where exploratory data analysis shows strong evidence of a non-stationary covariance structure. The aim of this paper is to investigate the modelling pipeline once non-stationarity has been detected in spatial data. We show that there is a real danger of over-fitting the model and that careful modelling is necessary in order to properly account for varying second-order structure. In fact, the example shows that sometimes non-stationary Gaussian random fields are not necessary to model non-stationary spatial data.},

We obtain a corresponding asymptotic expansion that is more accurate and more general than previous ones and use this to derive the de Wijs variogram under appropriate averaging, a result that can be interpreted as a two-dimensional spatial analogue of Brownian motion obtained as the limit of a random walk in one dimension. This provides a bridge between geostatistics, where the de Wijs process was once the most popular formulation, and Markov random fields, and also explains why statistical analysis using intrinsic autoregressions is usually robust to changes of scale. We briefly describe corresponding calculations in the frequency domain, including limiting results for higher-order autoregressions. The paper closes with some practical considerations, including applications to irregularly-spaced data.},

	abstract = {Gaussian conditional autoregressions have been widely used in spatial statistics and Bayesian image analysis, where they are intended to describe interactions between random variables at fixed sites in Euclidean space. The main appeal of these distributions is in the Markovian interpretation of their full conditionals. Intrinsic autoregressions are limiting forms that retain the Markov property. Despite being improper, they can have advantages over the standard autoregressions, both conceptually and in practice. For example, they often avoid difficulties in parameter estimation, without apparent loss, or exhibit appealing invariances, as in texture analysis. However, on small arrays and in nonlattice applications, both forms of autoregression can lead to undesirable second-order characteristics, either in the variables themselves or in contrasts among them. This paper discusses standard and intrinsic autoregressions and describes how the problems that arise can be alleviated using Dempster's (1972) algorithm or an appropriate modification. The approach represents a partial synthesis of standard geostatistical and Gaussian Markov random field formulations. Some nonspatial applications are also mentioned.},

	abstract = {Objective: Local activation time (LAT) mapping of the atria is important for targeted treatment of atrial arrhythmias, but current methods do not interpolate on the atrial manifold and neglect uncertainties associated with LAT observations. In this paper, we describe novel methods to, first, quantify uncertainties in LAT arising from bipolar electrogram analysis and assignment of electrode recordings to the anatomical mesh, second, interpolate uncertain LAT measurements directly on left atrial manifolds to obtain complete probabilistic activation maps, and finally, interpolate LAT jointly across both the manifold and different S1-S2 pacing protocols. Methods: A modified center of mass approach was used to process bipolar electrograms, yielding a LAT estimate and error distribution from the electrogram morphology. An error distribution for assigning measurements to the anatomical mesh was estimated. Probabilistic LAT maps were produced by interpolating on a left atrial manifold using Gaussian Markov random fields, taking into account observation errors and characterizing LAT predictions by their mean and standard deviation. This approach was extended to interpolate across S1-S2 pacing protocols. Results: We evaluated our approach using recordings from three patients undergoing atrial ablation. Cross-validation showed consistent and accurate prediction of LAT observations both at different locations on the left atrium and for different S1-S2 intervals. Significance: Interpolation of scalar and vector fields across anatomical structures from point measurements is a challenging problem in biomedical engineering, compounded by uncertainties in measurements and meshes. New methods and approaches are required, and in this paper, we have demonstrated an effective method for probabilistic interpolation of uncertain LAT.},

Therefore, a global daily picture cannot be achieved with measurements made in situ alone and needs to incorporate estimates from satellite retrievals. This article presents the science developed in the EU Horizon 2020–funded EUSTACE project (2015–19, {\textless}a href="http://www.eustaceproject.org/" target="\_blank"{\textgreater}www.eustaceproject.org{\textless}/a{\textgreater}) to produce global and European multidecadal ensembles of daily analyses of surface air temperature complementary to those from dynamical reanalyses, integrating different ground-based and satellite-borne data types. Relationships between surface air temperature measurements and satellite-based estimates of surface skin temperature over all surfaces of Earth (land, ocean, ice, and lakes) are quantified. Information contained in the satellite retrievals then helps to estimate air temperature and create global fields in the past, using statistical models of how surface air temperature varies in a connected way from place to place; this needs efficient statistical analysis methods to cope with the considerable data volumes. Daily fields are presented as ensembles to enable propagation of uncertainties through applications. Estimated temperatures and their uncertainties are evaluated against independent measurements and other surface temperature datasets. Achievements in the EUSTACE project have also included fundamental preparatory work useful to others, for example, gathering user requirements, identifying inhomogeneities in daily surface air temperature measurement series from weather stations, carefully quantifying uncertainties in satellite skin and air temperature estimates, exploring the interaction between air temperature and lakes, developing statistical models relevant to non-Gaussian variables, and methods for efficient computation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

Using the theory of stochastic partial differential equations, this model quantifies the uncertainties in the parameter space by means of the integrated nested Laplace approximation. In resolution tests using simulated data and in inversions using real data, our model matches the performance of conventional deterministic optimization approaches in retrieving three-dimensional structure of the Earth's mantle. In addition it delivers estimates of the full parameter covariance matrix. Our model substantially improves on previous work relying on Markov chain Monte Carlo methods in terms of statistical misfits and computing time.},

Understanding the effect of this control effort is vital to inform future control planning. However, the effect of malaria interventions across the varied epidemiological settings of Africa remains poorly understood owing to the absence of reliable surveillance data and the simplistic approaches underlying current disease estimates. Here we link a large database of malaria field surveys with detailed reconstructions of changing intervention coverage to directly evaluate trends from 2000 to 2015, and quantify the attributable effect of malaria disease control efforts. We found that Plasmodium falciparum infection prevalence in endemic Africa halved and the incidence of clinical disease fell by 40\% between 2000 and 2015. We estimate that interventions have averted 663 (542–753 credible interval) million clinical cases since 2000. Insecticide-treated nets, the most widespread intervention, were by far the largest contributor (68\% of cases averted). Although still below target levels, current malaria interventions have substantially reduced malaria disease incidence across the continent. Increasing access to these interventions, and maintaining their effectiveness in the face of insecticide and drug resistance, should form a cornerstone of post-2015 control strategies.},

	abstract = {Spatial processes are central to many ecological processes, but fitting models that incorporate spatial correlation to data from ecological surveys is computationally challenging. This is particularly true of point pattern data (in which the primary data are the locations at which target species are found), but also true of gridded data, and of georeferenced samples from continuous spatial fields. We describe here the {R} package inlabru that builds on the widely used RINLA package to provide easier access to Bayesian inference from spatial point process, spatial count, gridded, and georeferenced data, using integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA, Rue et al., 2009). The package provides methods for fitting spatial density surfaces and estimating abundance, as well as for plotting and prediction. It accommodates data that are points, counts, georeferenced samples, or distance sampling data. This paper describes the main features of the package, illustrated by fitting models to the gorilla nest data contained in the package spatstat (Baddeley, \& Turner, 2005), a line transect survey dataset contained in the package dsm (Miller, Rexstad, Burt, Bravington, \& Hedley, 2018), and to a georeferenced sample from a simulated continuous spatial field.},

	abstract = {Distance sampling is a widely used method for estimating wildlife population abundance. The fact that conventional distance sampling methods are partly design-based constrains the spatial resolution at which animal density can be estimated using these methods. Estimates are usually obtained at survey stratum level. For an endangered species such as the blue whale, it is desirable to estimate density and abundance at a finer spatial scale than stratum. Temporal variation in the spatial structure is also important. We formulate the process generating distance sampling data as a thinned spatial point process and propose model-based inference using a spatial log-Gaussian Cox process. The method adopts a flexible stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) approach to model spatial structure in density that is not accounted for by explanatory variables, and integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) for Bayesian inference. It allows simultaneous fitting of detection and density models and permits prediction of density at an arbitrarily fine scale. We estimate blue whale density in the Eastern Tropical Pacific Ocean from thirteen shipboard surveys conducted over 22 years. We find that higher blue whale density is associated with colder sea surface temperatures in space, and although there is some positive association between density and mean annual temperature, our estimates are consistent with no trend in density across years. Our analysis also indicates that there is substantial spatially structured variation in density that is not explained by available covariates.},

	abstract = {Introducing flexible covariance functions is critical for interpolating spatial data since the properties of interpolated surfaces depend on the covariance function used for Kriging. An extensive literature is devoted to covariance functions on Euclidean spaces, where the Matérn covariance family is a valid and flexible parametric family capable of controlling the smoothness of corresponding stochastic processes. Many applications in environmental statistics involve data located on spheres, where less is known about properties of covariance functions, and where the Matérn is not generally a valid model with great circle distance metric. In this paper, we advance the understanding of covariance functions on spheres by defining the notion of and proving a characterization theorem for m times mean square differentiable processes on d-dimensional spheres. Stochastic processes on spheres are commonly constructed by restricting processes on Euclidean spaces to spheres of lower dimension. We prove that the resulting sphere-restricted process retains its differentiability properties, which has the important implication that the Matérn family retains its full range of smoothness when applied to spheres so long as Euclidean distance is used. The restriction operation has been questioned for using Euclidean instead of great circle distance. To address this question, we construct several new covariance functions and compare them to the Matérn with Euclidean distance on the task of interpolating smooth and non-smooth datasets. The Matérnvwith Euclidean distance is not outperformed by the new covariance functions or the existing covariance functions, so we recommend using the Matérn with Euclidean distance due to the ease with which it can be computed.},

	abstract = {In this work, we consider a hierarchical spatio-temporal model for particulate matter (PM) concentration in the North-Italian region Piemonte. The model involves a Gaussian Field (GF), affected by a measurement error, and a state process characterized by a first order autoregressive dynamic model and spatially correlated innovations. This kind of model is well discussed and widely used in the air quality literature thanks to its flexibility in modelling the effect of relevant covariates (i.e. meteorological and geographical variables) as well as time and space dependence. However, Bayesian inference—through Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques—can be a challenge due to convergence problems and heavy computational loads. In particular, the computational issue refers to the infeasibility of linear algebra operations involving the big dense covariance matrices which occur when large spatio-temporal datasets are present. The main goal of this work is to present an effective estimating and spatial prediction strategy for the considered spatio-temporal model. This proposal consists in representing a GF with Matérn covariance function as a Gaussian Markov Random Field (GMRF) through the Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDE) approach. The main advantage of moving from a GF to a GMRF stems from the good computational properties that the latter enjoys. In fact, GMRFs are defined by sparse matrices that allow for computationally effective numerical methods. Moreover, when dealing with Bayesian inference for GMRFs, it is possible to adopt the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) algorithm as an alternative to MCMC methods giving rise to additional computational advantages. The implementation of the SPDE approach through the R-library INLA (www.r-inla.org) is illustrated with reference to the Piemonte PM data. In particular, providing the step-by-step R-code, we show how it is easy to get prediction and probability of exceedance maps in a reasonable computing time.},

	abstract = {Hierarchical spatial models are very flexible and popular for a vast array of applications in areas such as ecology, social science, public health, and atmospheric science. It is common to carry out Bayesian inference for these models via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Each iteration of the MCMC algorithm is computationally expensive due to costly matrix operations. In addition, the MCMC algorithm needs to be run for more iterations because the strong cross-correlations among the spatial latent variables result in slow mixing Markov chains. To address these computational challenges, we propose a projection-based intrinsic conditional autoregression (PICAR) approach, which is a discretized and dimension-reduced representation of the underlying spatial random field using empirical basis functions on a triangular mesh. Our approach exhibits fast mixing as well as a considerable reduction in computational cost per iteration. PICAR is computationally efficient and scales well to high dimensions. It is also automated and easy to implement for a wide array of user-specified hierarchical spatial models. We show, via simulation studies, that our approach performs well in terms of parameter inference and prediction. We provide several examples to illustrate the applicability of our method, including (i) a high-dimensional cloud cover dataset that showcases its computational efficiency, (ii) a spatially varying coefficient model that demonstrates the ease of implementation of PICAR in the probabilistic programming languages stan and nimble, and (iii) a watershed survey example that illustrates how PICAR applies to models that are not amenable to efficient inference via existing methods.},

            Correlation and smoothness are terms used to describe a wide variety of random quantities. In time, space, and many other domains, they both imply the same idea: quantities that occur closer together are more similar than those further apart. Two popular statistical models that represent this idea are basis-penalty smoothers (Wood in Texts in statistical science, CRC Press, Boca Raton, 2017) and stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) (Lindgren et al. in J R Stat Soc Series B (Stat Methodol) 73(4):423–498, 2011). In this paper, we discuss how the SPDE can be interpreted as a smoothing penalty and can be fitted using the  package , allowing practitioners with existing knowledge of smoothing penalties to better understand the implementation and theory behind the SPDE approach.

	abstract = {We introduce a class of scalable Bayesian hierarchical models for the analysis of massive geostatistical datasets. The underlying idea combines ideas on high-dimensional geostatistics by partitioning the spatial domain and modeling the regions in the partition using a sparsity-inducing directed acyclic graph (DAG). We extend the model over the DAG to a well-defined spatial process, which we call the meshed Gaussian process (MGP). A major contribution is the development of an MGPs on tessellated domains, accompanied by a Gibbs sampler for the efficient recovery of spatial random effects. In particular, the cubic MGP (Q-MGP) can harness high-performance computing resources by executing all large-scale operations in parallel within the Gibbs sampler, improving mixing and computing time compared to sequential updating schemes. Unlike some existing models for large spatial data, a Q-MGP facilitates massive caching of expensive matrix operations, making it particularly apt in dealing with spatiotemporal remote-sensing data. We compare Q-MGPs with large synthetic and real world data against state-of-the-art methods. We also illustrate using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index data from the Serengeti park region to recover latent multivariate spatiotemporal random effects at millions of locations.

As the heat kernel is intractable computationally, we approximate the covariance using finitely-many eigenpairs of the Graph Laplacian (GL). The GL is constructed from a kernel which depends only on the Euclidean coordinates of the inputs. Hence, we can benefit from the full knowledge about the kernel to extend the covariance structure to newly arriving samples by a Nystr{\textbackslash}"\{o\}m type extension.

	abstract = {Geostatistical models have traditionally been stationary. However, physical knowledge about underlying spatial processes often requires models with non-stationary dependence structures. Thus, there has been an interest in the literature to provide flexible models and computationally efficient methods for non-stationary phenomena. In this work, we demonstrate that the stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) approach to spatial modelling provides a flexible class of non-stationary models where explanatory variables can be easily included in the dependence structure. In addition, the SPDE approach enables computationally efficient Bayesian inference with integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA) available through the R-package r-inla. We illustrate the suggested modelling framework with a case study of annual precipitation in southern Norway, and compare a non-stationary model with dependence structure governed by elevation to a stationary model. Further, we use a simulation study to explore the annual precipitation models. We investigate identifiability of model parameters and whether the deviance information criterion (DIC) is able to distinguish datasets from the non-stationary and stationary models.},

	abstract = {Gaussian random fields (GRFs) play an important part in spatial modelling, but can be computationally infeasible for general covariance structures. An efficient approach is to specify GRFs via stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) and derive Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) approximations of the solutions. We consider the construction of a class of non-stationary GRFs with varying local anisotropy, where the local anisotropy is introduced by allowing the coefficients in the SPDE to vary with position. This is done by using a form of diffusion equation driven by Gaussian white noise with a spatially varying diffusion matrix. This allows for the introduction of parameters that control the GRF by parametrizing the diffusion matrix. These parameters and the GRF may be considered to be part of a hierarchical model and the parameters estimated in a Bayesian framework. The results show that the use of an SPDE with non-constant coefficients is a promising way of creating non-stationary spatial GMRFs that allow for physical interpretability of the parameters, although there are several remaining challenges that would need to be solved before these models can be put to general practical use.},

	abstract = {Estimation of the covariance structure of spatial processes is a fundamental prerequisite for problems of spatial interpolation and the design of monitoring networks. We introduce a nonparametric approach to global estimation of the spatial covariance structure of a random function Z(x, t) observed repeatedly at times ti (i = 1, ⋯, T) at a finite number of sampling stations xi (i = 1, 2, ..., N) in the plane. Our analyses assume temporal stationarity but do not assume spatial stationarity (or isotropy). We analyze the spatial dispersions \${\textbackslash}operatorname\{var\}(Z(x\_i, t) - Z(x\_j, t))\$ as a natural metric for the spatial covariance structure and model these as a general smooth function of the geographic coordinate of station pairs (xi, xj). The model is constructed in two steps. First, using nonmetric multidimensional scaling (MDS) we compute a two-dimensional representation of the sampling stations for which a monotone function of interpoint distances δij approximates the spatial dispersions. MDS transforms the problem into one for which the covariance structure, expressed in terms of spatial dispersions, is stationary and isotropic. Second, we compute thinplate splines to provide smooth mappings of the geographic representation of the sampling stations into their MDS representation. The composition of this mapping f and a monotone function g derived from MDS yields a nonparametric estimator of \${\textbackslash}operatorname\{var\}(Z(x\_a, t) - Z(x\_b, t))\$ for any two geographic locations xa and xb (monitored or not) of the form g(∣ f(xa) - f(xb(∣). By restricting the monotone function g to a class of conditionally nonpositive definite variogram functions, we ensure that the resulting nonparametric model corresponds to a nonnegative definite covariance model. We use biorthogonal grids, introduced by Bookstein in the field of morphometrics, to depict the thin-plate spline mappings that embody the nature of the anisotropy and nonstationarity in the sample covariance matrix. An analysis of mesoscale variability in solar radiation monitored in southwestern British Columbia demonstrates this methodology.},

If these datasets can be efficiently exploited, they can provide new insights on a wide variety of issues. However, traditional spatial-statistical techniques such as kriging are not computationally feasible for big datasets. We propose a multi-resolution approximation (M-RA) of Gaussian processes observed at irregular locations in space. The M-RA process is specified as a linear combination of basis functions at multiple levels of spatial resolution, which can capture spatial structure from very fine to very large scales. The basis functions are automatically chosen to approximate a given covariance function, which can be nonstationary. All computations involving the M-RA, including parameter inference and prediction, are highly scalable for massive datasets. Crucially, the inference algorithms can also be parallelized to take full advantage of large distributed-memory computing environments. In comparisons using simulated data and a large satellite dataset, the M-RA outperforms a related state-of-the-art method. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

	abstract = {Scoring rules assess the quality of probabilistic forecasts, by assigning a numerical score based on the predictive distribution and on the event or value that materializes. A scoring rule is proper if the forecaster maximizes the expected score for an observation drawn from the distributionF if he or she issues the probabilistic forecast F, rather than G ≠ F. It is strictly proper if the maximum is unique. In prediction problems, proper scoring rules encourage the forecaster to make careful assessments and to be honest. In estimation problems, strictly proper scoring rules provide attractive loss and utility functions that can be tailored to the problem at hand. This article reviews and develops the theory of proper scoring rules on general probability spaces, and proposes and discusses examples thereof. Proper scoring rules derive from convex functions and relate to information measures, entropy functions, and Bregman divergences. In the case of categorical variables, we prove a rigorous version of the Savage representation. Examples of scoring rules for probabilistic forecasts in the form of predictive densities include the logarithmic, spherical, pseudospherical, and quadratic scores. The continuous ranked probability score applies to probabilistic forecasts that take the form of predictive cumulative distribution functions. It generalizes the absolute error and forms a special case of a new and very general type of score, the energy score. Like many other scoring rules, the energy score admits a kernel representation in terms of negative definite functions, with links to inequalities of Hoeffding type, in both univariate and multivariate settings. Proper scoring rules for quantile and interval forecasts are also discussed. We relate proper scoring rules to Bayes factors and to cross-validation, and propose a novel form of cross-validation known as random-fold cross-validation. A case study on probabilistic weather forecasts in the North American Pacific Northwest illustrates the importance of propriety. We note optimum score approaches to point and quantile estimation, and propose the intuitively appealing interval score as a utility function in interval estimation that addresses width as well as coverage.},

Although WAIC is asymptotically equal to LOO, we demonstrate that PSIS-LOO is more robust in the ﬁnite case with weak priors or inﬂuential observations. As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for comparison of predictive errors between two models.

Changes in diurnal temperature range can have implications for human health, ecology and hydrology, among others. Yet, the statistical literature on modelling diurnal temperature range is lacking. This paper proposes to model the distribution of diurnal temperature range using the five-parameter lambda distribution (FPLD). Additionally, in order to model diurnal temperature range with explanatory variables, we propose a distributional quantile regression model that combines quantile regression with marginal modelling using the FPLD. Inference is performed using the method of quantiles. The models are fitted to 30 years of daily observations of diurnal temperature range from 112 weather stations in the southern part of Norway. The flexible FPLD shows great promise as a model for diurnal temperature range, and performs well against competing models. The regression model is fitted to diurnal temperature range data using geographic, orographic and climatological explanatory variables. It performs well and captures much of the spatial variation in the distribution of diurnal temperature range in Norway.},

The computational cost in fitting an fGn model of length n using a likelihood-based approach is \$\$\{\{{\textbackslash}mathcal \{O\}\}\}(n{\textasciicircum}\{2\})\$\$, exploiting the Toeplitz structure of the covariance matrix. In most realistic cases, we do not observe the fGn process directly but only through indirect Gaussian observations, so the Toeplitz structure is easily lost and the computational cost increases to \$\$\{\{{\textbackslash}mathcal \{O\}\}\}(n{\textasciicircum}\{3\})\$\$. This paper presents an approximate fGn model of \$\$\{\{{\textbackslash}mathcal \{O\}\}\}(n)\$\$computational cost, both with direct and indirect Gaussian observations, with or without conditioning. This is achieved by approximating fGn with a weighted sum of independent first-order autoregressive (AR) processes, fitting the parameters of the approximation to match the autocorrelation function of the fGn model. The resulting approximation is stationary despite being Markov and gives a remarkably accurate fit using only four AR components. Specifically, the given approximate fGn model is incorporated within the class of latent Gaussian models in which Bayesian inference is obtained using the methodology of integrated nested Laplace approximation. The performance of the approximate fGn model is demonstrated in simulations and two real data examples.},

Given the mathematical difficulties for the construction of covariance functions for processes defined over spheres cross time, approximations of the state of nature have been proposed in the literature by using the Euclidean (based on map projections) and the chordal distances. We present several methods of construction based on the great circle distance and provide closed-form expressions for both spatio-temporal and multivariate cases. A simulation study assesses the discrepancy between the great circle distance, chordal distance, and Euclidean distance based on a map projection both in terms of estimation and prediction in a space-time and a bivariate spatial setting, where the space is in this case the Earth. We revisit the analysis of Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) data and investigate differences in terms of estimation and prediction between the aforementioned distance-based approaches. Both simulation and real data highlight sensible differences in terms of estimation of the spatial scale parameter. As far as prediction is concerned, the differences can be appreciated only when the interpoint distances are large, as demonstrated by an illustrative example.

The method is based on an approximate series expansion of the covariance function in terms of an eigenfunction expansion of the Laplace operator in a compact subset of \$\${\textbackslash}mathbb \{R\}{\textasciicircum}d\$\$. On this approximate eigenbasis, the eigenvalues of the covariance function can be expressed as simple functions of the spectral density of the Gaussian process, which allows the GP inference to be solved under a computational cost scaling as \$\${\textbackslash}mathcal \{O\}(nm{\textasciicircum}2)\$\$ (initial) and \$\${\textbackslash}mathcal \{O\}(m{\textasciicircum}3)\$\$ (hyperparameter learning) with m basis functions and n data points. Furthermore, the basis functions are independent of the parameters of the covariance function, which allows for very fast hyperparameter learning. The approach also allows for rigorous error analysis with Hilbert space theory, and we show that the approximation becomes exact when the size of the compact subset and the number of eigenfunctions go to infinity. We also show that the convergence rate of the truncation error is independent of the input dimensionality provided that the differentiability order of the covariance function increases appropriately, and for the squared exponential covariance function it is always bounded by \$\$\{{\textbackslash}sim \}1/m\$\$ regardless of the input dimensionality. The expansion generalizes to Hilbert spaces with an inner product which is defined as an integral over a specified input density.

                  of landscape transformation that may alter
                  ecological processes such as predator--prey
                  interactions. We tested the hypothesis that wind
                  farms increase the activity of nest predators and,
                  ultimately, increment ground-nest predation rates.
                  We placed 18 plots in Iberian shrub-steppes (11 at
                  control and seven at wind farm sites), each one
                  comprised nine artificial ground-nests (three quail
                  eggs/nest). Artificial nests were placed during two
                  events: at the beginning (April) and at the end
                  (June) of the breeding season in 2016
                  (n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}324 artificial nests). We
                  estimated the relative abundance of avian and large
                  mammalian predators in the surroundings of each plot
                  and recorded nest fate after 12 days exposure. We
                  also measured variables at landscape and
                  microhabitat scale that potentially affect predator
                  abundance and nest predation. Wind farm sites
                  contained higher cover of gravel roads and more
                  large mammalian predators. Moreover, the abundance
                  of large mammalian predators increased with
                  surrounding cover of both trees and gravel-roads.
                  Avian predator abundance and nest predation rates
                  did not differ between control and wind farm sites,
                  though nest predation did increase with the
                  surrounding cover of crops and gravel roads. Lastly,
                  nest predation was higher at the end of the breeding
                  season and decreased with moss and lichen cover. Our
                  results support previous evidence on the increase of
                  mammalian predator abundance as the surface area of
                  gravel-roads increases, pointing towards a potential
                  mechanism for wind farms leading to rise ground-nest
                  predation. Future wind energy projects should
                  minimize the development of gravel-roads for wind
                  turbine access or maintenance.},

abstract={Fire is one of the most notorious hazards in Australia, with important economic impacts and damage to ecosystems. There is a concern of worsening fire conditions under climate variability, but there is little understanding of the variability in fire occurrence related to climate patterns. We present a statistical decomposition for spatio-temporal analysis of changes in fire occurrence in Australia and its association with climate factors. We found evidence of variability in the trend results for fire occurrence, and also some evidence that this variation is related to climate patterns. Our approach has applicability to other climate-related issues, providing a useful tool to identify possible changes in the intensity of occurrence over time, capturing long-term changes, and also seasonal and cyclical effects.},

                  intensity model based on the Log {Gaussian} Cox
                  process (LGCP). We discuss the use of various types

ABSTRACT = {Modelling field spatial patterns is standard practice for the analysis of plant breeding. Jointly fitting the genetic relationship among individuals and spatial information enables better separability between the variance due to genetics and field variation. This study aims to quantify the accuracy and bias of estimative parameters using different approaches. We contrasted three settings for the genetic term: no relationship (I), pedigree relationship (A), and genomic relationship (G); and a set of approaches for the spatial variation: no-spatial (NS), moving average covariate (MA), row-column adjustment (RC), autoregressive AR1 × AR1 (AR), spatial stochastic partial differential equations, or SPDE (SD), nearest neighbor graph (NG), and Gaussian kernel (GK). Simulations were set to represent soybean field trials at F2:4 generation. Heritability was sampled from a uniform distribution U(0,1). The simulated residual-to-spatial ratio between residual variance and spatial variance (Ve:Vs) ranged from 9:1 to 1:9. Experimental settings were conducted under an augmented block design with the systematic distribution of checks accounting for 10% of the plots. Relationship information had a substantial impact on the accuracy of the genetic values (G &gt; A &gt; I) and contributed to the accuracy of spatial effects (30.63–42.27% improvement). Spatial models were ranked based on an improvement to the accuracy of estimative of genetic effects as SD ≥ GK ≥ AR ≥ NG ≥ MA &gt; RC ≥ NS, and to the accuracy of estimative of spatial effects as GK ≥ SD ≥ NG &gt; AR ≥ MA &gt; RC. Estimates of genetic and spatial variance were generally biased downwards, whereas residual variances were biased upwards. The advent of relationship information reduced the bias of all variance components. Spatial methods SD, AR, and GK provided the least biased estimates of spatial and residual variance.},

                  and predator/prey interactions) and support
                  development of management and conservation measures.
                  Data from an array of echolocation-click detectors
                  (C-PODs) were analyzed using Bayesian spatiotemporal
                  modeling to investigate spatial and temporal
                  variation in occurrence and foraging activity of
                  harbor porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) and how this
                  variation was influenced by daylight and presence of
                  bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). The
                  probability of occurrence of porpoises was highest
                  on an offshore sandbank, where the proportion of
                  detections with foraging clicks was relatively low.
                  The porpoises' overall distribution shifted
                  throughout the summer and autumn, likely influenced
                  by seasonal prey availability. Probability of
                  porpoise occurrence was lowest in areas close to the
                  coast, where dolphin detections were highest and
                  declined prior to dolphin detection, leading
                  potentially to avoidance of spatiotemporal overlap
                  between porpoises and dolphins. Increased
                  understanding of porpoises' seasonal distribution,
                  key foraging areas, and their relationship with
                  competitors can shed light on management options and
                  potential interactions with offshore industries.}

                  Laplace approximation with stochastic partial
                  differential equation ({INLA}-{SPDE}) for modeling the

                  incision depth, road network, population, and land
                  cover, were used to delineate the distribution of
                  human disturbance. Our method includes an improved
                  {SPDE} construction approach that allows the detection
                  of non-stationary data in NTL datasets. Among four

                  previous research shows that, the estimation results

  abstract =	 {Based on the introduction of the basic ideas and
                  related technologies of partial differential
                  equations, as well as the method of path planning,
                  the application of partial differential equations in
                  solving urban path planning is studied. The path
                  planning model of partial differential equations and
                  the setting of obstacle boundary conditions are
                  introduced, and adaptive. Theoretical research and
                  experimental results show that it is feasible and
                  effective to solve urban path planning by partial
                  differential equations, which provides a new way for
                  urban path planning research ideas and methods. This
                  paper proposes an image detection algorithm based on
                  diffusion equation. According to the logarithmic
                  transformation, the multiplicative speckle noise in
                  the image can be converted into additive noise. We
                  first perform logarithmic transformation on the
                  image and then use the denoising model of the
                  diffusion equation to filter out the noise in the
                  image and then use the logarithm to recognize the
                  image. The difference image is obtained by the
                  domain difference method, and finally, the
                  difference image is classified by the clustering
                  algorithm, and the change area is extracted.
                  Experiments show that the algorithm can effectively
                  reduce the effect of multiplicative speckle noise on
                  the change detection results, improve the accuracy
                  of change detection, and shorten the change
                  detection time. This article takes the path planning
                  problem of a two-dimensional space city as an
                  example to discuss the application of partial
                  differential equations. According to the principle
                  of energy conservation, this paper uses the
                  two-dimensional space radiant heat conduction
                  equation as an example to model and illustrate the
                  solution of the path planning problem.},

                  (distribution, density) and function (viability) of
                  the seagrass sediment seed bank, the storage of
                  viable propagules (e.g. seeds, tubers, diaspores) in
                  the sediment over time,in the northern Great Barrier
                  Reef World Heritage Area in Cairns, Queensland,
                  following a large-scale decline in seagrass area. A
                  spatially explicit seagrass seed bank analysis was
                  paired with a long-term annual assessment of
                  seagrass distribution to assess seed bank spatial
                  patterns and their relationship with the recovery
                  and presence of seagrass, and water depth. Four
                  years post-decline, the seed bank contained
                  <i>Zostera muelleri</i>, <i>Halodule uninervis</i>,
                  <i>Halophila ovalis</i> and <i>Cymodocea
                  serrulata</i> seeds. Seed banks reflected adjacent
                  meadow community composition; however, the density
                  of seeds for all recorded species was significantly
                  lower than analogous seagrass populations,
                  indicating a reduction in the capacity for recovery
                  from the seed bank. A spatial structure existed in
                  both the total (viable + non-viable) and viable seed
                  bank, and distance between seed clusters ranged from
                  50-550 m depending on species and seed type.
                  Observed patterns in clustering may be explained by
                  variation in water depth and the past distribution
                  of seagrass in these meadows. These results
                  demonstrate that the distribution of seagrass seeds
                  within the seed bank, which directly influences the
                  natural recovery of seagrass communities, is not
                  uniform across species and may result in patchy
                  recovery of the meadows. Therefore, the resilience
                  provided by the seed bank in seagrass communities
                  should not be viewed as a static level of insurance
                  for the entire meadow, but rather as dynamic and
                  species-specific, with variability over both space
                  and time.},

                  important benthic resource in Chile. Due to their
                  large-scale spatial metapopulation structure, sea
                  urchin subpopulations are interconnected by larval
                  dispersion, so the recovery of local abundance
                  depends on the distance and hydrodynamic
                  characteristics of their spatial domain. Currently,
                  this resource is evaluated with classical stock
                  assessment models, using standardized catch per unit
                  effort (an index of relative abundance) as a key
                  piece of information to determine catch quotas and
                  achieve sustainability. However, these estimates
                  assume hyperstability for the total population,
                  ignoring spatial dependence among fishing sites,
                  which is a fundamental concept for populations
                  structured as metapopulation. We develop a Bayesian
                  catch standardization model with explicit spatial
                  dependence to better address the structure of this
                  population. The proposed model performs
                  statistically better compared to a model without
                  spatial dependence, based on leave-one-out
                  cross-validation, and predictive distributions also
                  show that parameter estimation is consistent with
                  the data. We argue that incorporating spatial
                  structure improves the estimated relative abundance
                  index in a population structured as a
                  metapopulation. Our improved index of abundance will
                  lead to better assessments and management advice,
                  thus improving the sustainability of the stock.}

Location Three study areas in the north-eastern Caribbean, Anguilla, Saba Bank and St. Eustatius. Methods A novel towed video system and complemented belt transects to estimate adult queen conch densities throughout its depth range. Bayesian hierarchical spatial models (integrated nested Laplace approximations) modelled distribution patterns of adult conch. Results Our study revealed patchy distribution patterns of adult conch caused by spatial dependency. This dependency is most likely related to aggregating behaviour during spawning events. Environmental variables, such as algal cover, distance to the open ocean and depth, showed important nonlinear effects on conch abundance, although these differed among study areas. Intermediate and deep areas (ca. 17–45 m) contain most of the reproductive output of conch in the study areas and are highly important for the reproductive capacity. Main conclusions The general patchy distribution pattern and the lack of strong generic relationships between biotic and abiotic factors and adult conch abundance and distribution are likely to be at least partly due to spatial dependency and location-specific factors, which affect different phases of the conch's life history. The depth distribution of conch also indicates that surveying areas at depths beyond the practical limitation of divers is of great importance to obtain more reliable population estimates.}

Often this is done through the use of an Age Length Key (ALK), which links a subsample of fish that have had their ages determined to those that have only had their lengths measured in order to obtain an estimate of the age structure of the entire sample. ALKs can suffer from data gaps and sampling artifacts and are limited in both how they can reflect spatial variability and how spatial information can be incorporated. We propose a novel spatial ALK model that uses an approximation of a Gaussian Field and has the ability to account for physical barriers (e.g. islands, coastlines) in the study area. Our approach is compared with a previously suggested spatial ALK model as well as non-spatial approaches using both real and simulated survey data. We find that spatial ALK approaches reduce errors in stratified estimates of abundance at age over non-spatial approaches and that incorporating physical barriers can deliver more realistic results.}

journal={Marine Ecology Progress Series},
year={2021},
volume={665},
pages={217-231},
abstract={ABSTRACT: Killer whales <i>Orcinus orca</i> have a cosmopolitan distribution with a broad diet ranging from fish to marine mammals. In Norway, killer whales are regularly observed feeding on overwintering Norwegian spring-spawning (NSS) herring <i>Clupea harengus</i> inside the fjords. However, their offshore foraging behavior and distribution are less well understood. In particular, it is not known to what degree they rely on the NSS herring stock when the herring move to deeper offshore waters. Satellite telemetry data from 29 male killer whales were analyzed to assess whether their offshore foraging behavior is linked to herring distribution. Unlike most marine predator-prey studies that use indirect proxies for prey abundance and distribution, our study utilized 2 herring density estimates based on (1) direct observations from acoustic trawl survey data and (2) simulations from a fully coupled ecosystem model. Mixed effects models were used to infer the effect of herring density and light intensity on whale movement patterns. Our results suggest that killer whales follow NSS herring over long distances along the coast from their inshore overwintering areas to offshore spawning grounds. All whales changed from fast, directed, to slow, non-directed movement when herring density increased, although individuals had different propensities towards movement. Our data indicated that whales continue to feed on herring along the Norwegian shelf. We conclude that NSS herring constitute an important prey resource for at least some killer whales in the northeastern Atlantic, not only during the herring overwintering period, but also subsequently throughout the herring spawning migration.},

	abstract = {Spatial models often assume isotropy and stationarity, implying that spatial dependence is direction invariant and uniform throughout the study area. However, these assumptions are violated when dispersal barriers are present in the form of geographical features or disease control interventions. Despite this, the issue of non-stationarity has been little explored in the context of plant health. The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of different barriers in the distribution of the quarantine plant pathogenic bacterium Xylella fastidiosa in the demarcated area in Alicante, Spain. Occurrence data from the official surveys in 2018 were analyzed with four spatial Bayesian hierarchical models: i) a stationary model representing a scenario without any control interventions or geographical features; ii) a model with mountains as physical barriers; iii) a model with a continuous or iv) discontinuous perimeter barrier as control interventions surrounding the infested area. Barriers were assumed to be totally impermeable, so they should be interpreted as areas without host plants and in which it is not possible for infected vectors or propagating plant material to pass through. Inference and prediction were performed through the integrated nested Laplace approximation methodology and the stochastic partial differential equation approach. In the stationary model the posterior mean of the spatial range was 4,030.17 m 95\% CI (2,907.41, 5,563.88), meaning that host plants that are closer to an infected plant than this distance would be at risk for X. fastidiosa. This distance can be used to define the buffer zone around the infested area in Alicante. In the non-stationary models, the posterior mean of the spatial range varied from 3,860.88 m 95\% CI (2,918.61, 5,212.18) in the mountain barrier model to 6,141.08 m 95\% CI (4,296.32, 9,042.99) in the continuous barrier model. Compared with the stationary model, the perimeter barrier models decreased the probability of X. fastidiosa presence in the area outside the barrier. Differences between the discontinuous and continuous barrier models showed that breaks in areas with low sampling intensity resulted in a higher probability of X. fastidiosa presence. These results may help authorities prioritize the areas for surveillance and implementation of control measures.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

        abstract = {Gaussian Markov random fields (GMRFs) are frequently used as computationally efficient models in spatial statistics. Unfortunately, it has traditionally been difficult to link GMRFs with the more traditional Gaussian random field models, as the Markov property is difficult to deploy in continuous space. Following the pioneering work of Lindgren et al. (2011), we expound on the link between Markovian Gaussian random fields and GMRFs. In particular, we discuss the theoretical and practical aspects of fast computation with continuously specified Markovian Gaussian random fields, as well as the clear advantages they offer in terms of clear, parsimonious, and interpretable models of anisotropy and non-stationarity.},
